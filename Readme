YouTube Clone with Speed Warning 🚗📹

A modern YouTube clone replicating YouTube's 2025 interface, featuring a responsive video grid, search functionality, and a unique 
speed monitoring system. The app displays live speeds (0–120 km/h),when the person is driving, shows an eye-catching warning when speed exceeds 80 km/h along with a warning sound 
and pauses videos after 3 seconds of overspeeding (if a video is playing).

Built with HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript, it uses 
the YouTube Data API v3 for video data and the HTML5 Audio API for warning sounds.
